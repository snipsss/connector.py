# connector.py

this program allows you to work with sql queries only the current database pool interface is quite simple to understand...
I also used the oop concept, which was nice for me
The project has completed 2 out of 3 stages of full completion. This is my first project, do not judge strictly :)

databasepool=["finance",
             "information_schema",
              "means",
              mysql,
              "performance_schema",
              "sakila",
              "sys",
              "world"]
